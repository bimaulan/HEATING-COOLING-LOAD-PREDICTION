# Web Application To Predict Heating and Cooling Load of a Building
This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting Heating and Cooling Load and building Web Application for that using Streamlit
```
Source: The dataset was created by Angeliki Xifara and was processed by Athanasios Tsanas, Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK).
